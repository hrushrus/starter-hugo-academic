# Abstract.
abstract = "Global cooperation with respect to greenhouse gas emissions mitigation is contingent on finding common ground in addressing the problem of adaptation to climate change impacts. This paper uses a non-cooperative game theory model to investigate the relationship between adaptation technology and the formation of emission-reducing International Environmental Agreements (IEAs) on climate change, with countries that are heterogeneous with respect to the benefits and costs of both mitigation and adaptation.While differences in climate vulnerability are a deterrent for cooperation, increasing the effectiveness of adaptation in highly vulnerable countries can foster an IEA. Both traditional free-riding on climate change mitigation efforts, and free-riding on adaptation technology among members of an IEA can be reduced by transfers of adaptation technology within the IEA. A numerical example with parameters estimated from climate change data is used to simulate stable coalitions and demonstrate how the transfer of adaptation technology reduces free-riding on an IEA."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
#summary = "A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location, to inform the user of local stores where similar clothing items can be tried on."
